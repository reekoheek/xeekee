<h2>Hello Friend!</h2>

<p>
    You see me because you haven't override templates or default routes. May be
    this is your fist journey through the world of Bono. I wish you will enjoy
    and get comfortable to the world of productive application development.
</p>

<p>
    You can override the route from <code>www/index.php</code> file.
    Or if you just want to override the template, you can override it from (or
    create new file at) <code>templates/home.php</code>.
</p>

<p>
    If you dont like the way your application looks like you can override
    the layout or implement custom theme.
</p>

<p>
    Best regards,<br>
    Bono Team
